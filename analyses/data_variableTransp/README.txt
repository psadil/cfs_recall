these data were abandonded on October 2, 2017. Very little learning was happening
in the binocular condition (both in terms of RT and Naming performance), and so
it seemed like there was very little hope of participants learning enough during
the CFS condition. In this experiment, items were studied for up to 4 seconds.
binocular objects would increase in opacity during that entire period, so were never
shown fully opaque. additionally, there was an attempt to calibrate breakthrough time
on CFS trials, which often meant that CFS items were presented at _very_ low opacity.
